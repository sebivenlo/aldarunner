= Analysis and Design

Funtion requirements

* compile code and tests and run tests
* publish test reports
* compute test summary and coverage summary
* conditionally run AB and BA tests (setup)

Params to tests runner:

* test type (BB,BA,AB,B0..Bn)
* grp
* app

How to run tests
* mvn -q -fn -P jacoco test jacoco:report surefire-report:report-only site -DgenerateReports=false
* create test summary file in .../site
`cat target/surefire-reports/*.txt | aldatestsummary`

base for test is BB
such that for every test in BB there should be a failing one in one of Bx,
otherwise the test never fails.
This allows to fix the API without having to required specific test names.

Report is somethinng like SomeTest.testXYZ never fails, are you sure you are testing anything there?
