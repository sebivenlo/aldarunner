Setting up Github Actions:

1:
Create a assignment repository or have one available on GitHub.
2:
Make sure that in the pom.xml file the version is set to 3.0.3 or simply copy: <version>3.0.3</version>.
3:
If not present, create in to root directory a settings.xml file in which you put the following code:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>sebivenlo</id>
            <repositories>
                <repository>
                    <id>fontysvenlo.org</id>
                    <url>https://www.fontysvenlo.org/repository</url>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>sebivenlo</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
    <offline>false</offline>
    <servers>
        
    </servers>
</settings>
You can find your own personal settings file at: C:\Users\Your_PC_Name\.m2\settings.xml
4:
Then navigate to your project repository on Github and go to actions
5:
Select Java with Maven as we will be using a Maven builder for this Step By Step Guide.
6:
This will build a template Maven builder, which will not run out of the box.
If you navigate back to Actions and then to Java Cl with Maven it will show you the status of your Github Action.
Which will show you it failed
7:
This is why we added the settings.xml earlier so we can use this to reach the sebi maven builder
you can call this builder by adding these lines to the GitHub Action, replacing the steps with the same names:

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml --settings settings.xml
    - name: Publish Test Report
      if: ${{ always() }}
      uses: scacap/action-surefire-report@v1

Note that, this step also comes with a test report which will only provide you with any details about the tests, if they fail.
Also if you click on your Java CI with Maven actions, you will find a button allowing you to rerun your job, but typically it will rerun
after every Git push as we defined it as such.

With all this done, you prepared your assignment for automated test reporting, which you can then directly use in GitHub Classrooms.
